## Tuesday's Homework
* Well done for getting the back end up and running!

* Before moving on to today's homework, I recommend getting the index page working. Then try the routing, show, and form when you've got that.

## Wednesday's Feedback
* Excellent work on this one! Well done for getting caught up and getting the delete route working!

* When you come to do your Edit component, remember that you'll need to make two axios requests: a get request to populate the form, and a put request to update it.
